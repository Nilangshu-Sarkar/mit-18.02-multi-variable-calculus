# 📐 MIT 18.02SC — Multivariable Calculus (Complete Notes & Problem Sets)

This repository contains my **complete, self-driven work** for **MIT 18.02SC: Multivariable Calculus**, completed through a rigorous problem-solving approach with full derivations, geometric reasoning, and carefully written solutions.

The focus throughout is **conceptual clarity, geometric intuition, and mathematical structure**, rather than mechanical computation.

---

## 📘 Course Overview

**MIT 18.02SC** develops calculus in higher dimensions, emphasizing geometry, vector fields, and integral theorems that form the backbone of advanced mathematics, physics, and engineering.

Key themes include:
- Geometry of curves and surfaces
- Vector fields and differential operators
- Line, surface, and volume integrals
- Green’s, Stokes’, and Divergence Theorems
- Physical interpretation via fluid flow and fields

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each problem set corresponds to the official **MIT 18.02SC** curriculum and includes:

- 📄 **Clean LaTeX solutions**
- ✏️ **Explicit derivations (no skipped logic)**
- 📐 **Geometric interpretations**
- 🧠 **Reasoning-based problem selection** (not all routine problems included)


Each folder contains:
- Final compiled PDFs
- Source LaTeX files
- Supporting sketches where necessary

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Philosophy

This repository reflects the following principles:

- **No blind computation** — every formula is justified
- **Geometry first** — algebra follows intuition
- **Selective rigor** — trivial exercises omitted; conceptually rich problems prioritized
- **Theorems treated as tools**, not black boxes

In many cases, problems were chosen strategically to maximize conceptual coverage rather than quantity.

## 🧪 Mathematical Maturity Emphasis

Special attention is given to:
- **Domain connectedness**
- **Breakdown of theorems due to singularities**
- **When theorems apply — and when they don’t**
- **Physical meaning of divergence, curl, and flux**

These aspects are often skipped in routine coursework but are essential for advanced physics and mathematics.

## 📌 Why This Repository Exists

This repository serves as:

- A **personal mathematical record**
- A **reference for vector calculus**
- A **foundation for physics courses** (E&M, fluid mechanics, field theory)
- Evidence of **independent mastery**, not classroom completion

## 🏁 Final Note

This work represents a **closed chapter**—but not an endpoint.

The ideas here reappear continuously in:
- Classical mechanics
- Electromagnetism
- Fluid dynamics
- Differential geometry
- Modern theoretical physics

This repository is not about speed.  
It is about **understanding that lasts**.
